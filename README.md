# todo
## App on Vue 2.

### 1. Pages:
- page with all lists and tasks,
- one task page,
- settings.

### 2. Actions:
- create the list, 
- rename the list,
- move lists,
- create tasks in the list,
- edit the task,
- complete the task,
- move the task,
- delete the task,
- change the accent color,
- change the dark theme.

### 3. Optional items from the test task:
1) Implemented task deletion confirmation.
for the rest of the actions, I did not add, them because the user can easily fix them himself. and extra modal windows annoy users.
For convenience, I have added notifications for some actions to draw attention to this.
2) My application is on MEVN - the state is saved, maybe I get data from the back. Local storage stores data on the main color, dark theme, and menu position.
3) Implemented cancellation of task deletion. You can cancel within 5 seconds after deletion.
4) App design based on Vuetify.
5) Tests are not implemented.
6) Adaptive layout implemented.
